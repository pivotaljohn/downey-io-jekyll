I'm currently working on building a Kubernetes cluster out of a batch of Raspberry Pi 3 Bs and B+s. More on that, though, in a later post once I get it working. This post is entirely about me getting sidetracked after reading a few reports of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B getting pretty toasty under load. I had read that these newer, more powerful Pis can actually reach some considerable temperatures when stressed and that they might benefit from some aftermarket cooling.

I went off and did some research and found that for my purposes (an open air cluster), a simple aluminum heatsink on the CPU should suffice. What I didn't know was how I should attach the heat sinks to the Pis. Many heat sinks you can purchase come with thermal tape pre-applied, but some of the reviews on Amazon implied that the tape wasn't actually thermally conductive and that it just made things worse. So I decided to experiment with using thermal paste, just like in a full-size PC!

We'll be exploring the thermal performance of one of my Pis under the following three configurations:

1. Without any heat sink
2. With a heat sink attached with thermal paste
3. With a heat sink attached with thermal tape

## Materials
I purchased the following supplies to conduct these experiments. ðŸ”¬

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://amzn.to/2ME265w)
* [Easycargo Aluminum + Copper Heatsinks](https://amzn.to/2IK56L4)
* [Cooler Master Thermal Paste](https://amzn.to/2KlHuSW)
* [Adafruit Heat Sink Thermal Tape](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1468)
* 91% Isopropyl Alcohol (for removing thermal paste)

## Methodology
This experiment was fairly unscientific. I only tested one of my Model Bs and ignored the B+s since they are purported to have better thermal properties and I imagine the heat sink's effect would be less dramatic.

To start, I performed a clean install of Raspbian Stretch Lite on to the Pi and `ssh`ed on in two separate terminal windows.

In the first window I ran [this bash script](https://github.com/tcdowney/knick-knacks/blob/c298eee072c7ecd851389879ebdfed3367a4d013/raspberry-pi/raspi-metrics.sh) to collect fifteen minutes worth of temperature and CPU clock speed metrics and write them out to a CSV file.

```bash
./raspi-metrics.sh 900 > /tmp/cpu-temp-2018-07-01.csv
```

Then in the second terminal I ran the [stress](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stress) command to put load on all four of the Raspberry Pi 3's cores to heat things up a bit.

```bash
(sleep 30 && stress -c 4) & (sleep 600 && kill -9 $(pgrep stress))
```

This resulted in 30 seconds of low CPU idling, ~9.5 minutes of heavy CPU usage using `stress -c 4`, and 5 minutes of cool down time after killing the `stress` processes.

## Experiment 1 - No Heat Sink
In the first experiment I tested the Raspberry Pi as-is, without any heat sink installed.

</div>

Once the `stress` kicks in, the temperature climbs rapidly and maxes out at ~82 degrees Celsius. The Pi is allegedly supposed to start thermally throttling at 85 Â°C, but I was unable to get it to reach this temperature. Maybe if I had a poorly ventilated enclosure...

## Experiment 2 - Heat Sink with Thermal Paste
<div>

</div>

In the second experiment I tested the Raspberry Pi with an aluminum heat sink adhered with thermal paste -- just like in a "real" computer! The heat sinks I ordered came with thermal tape pre-applied, but so I foolishly scraped it all off and cleaned off the remaining tape residue with some concentrated isopropyl alcohol.

</div>

Adding the heat sink with thermal paste to the Pi improved things quite a bit! I saw a roughly 10 degree lower maximum temperature and the the Pi both took longer to reach this temperature and cooled down faster. Without active cooling, though, I wonder if it would have reached into the 80s eventually.

Unfortunately, despite being dubbed "paste", the thermal paste was not actually as adhesive as I would have liked. The heat sinks stayed on, but they would slide around if nudged or bumped. This is fine if your Pi is housed in a proper enclosure, but I'm planning on leaving my cluster fairly exposed. In a full-sized computer, heat sinks are normally clamped or screwed into place, but these mini heat sinks are held on solely by their adhesive. I probably should have just left the thermal tape on the heat sinks and used that. So I ordered some more tape from Adafruit. ðŸ˜Š

## Experiment 3 - Heat Sink with Thermal Tape
Nearly a month later, I had time again to redo the experiment with the thermal tape I ordered. So I removed the heat sink and thermal paste using more 91% isopropyl alcohol and tried again using the tape.

</div>

The tape clearly did not perform as well as the paste -- in fact, the results were only marginally better than not using a heat sink at all! Although the temperature increased less rapidly and cooled off faster, it still approached a max temperature that was only a few degrees lower than without a heat sink. On the plus side, the tape did adhere the heat sinks to the CPU much more strongly than the paste!

## Results

I did see significant thermal performance improvements when using the heat sinks along with thermal paste. Unfortunately, given my plans for the Pis I did not want to have to worry about the heat sinks getting bumped so I switched to thermal tape. The tape + heat sinks offered slight benefits over not using a heat sink at all, but probably not enough to justify the expense. Even if it isn't actually cooler, the Pis certainly _look_ cooler with heat sinks, so maybe they are worth it after all.  Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
