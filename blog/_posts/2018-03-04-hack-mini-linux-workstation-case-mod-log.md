 "Recently I've found myself wanting a dedicated desktop machine just for coding. Although I do most of my development at work on iMacs and at home on an aging MacBook Air, I decided against buying another Mac -- the price and performance I wanted just wasn't there. \"Linux is close enough\", I thought, so I decided to build this small, discrete machine just for development."

Recently I've found myself wanting a dedicated desktop machine just for coding. Although I do most of my development at work on iMacs and at home on an aging MacBook Air, I decided against buying another Mac -- the price and performance I wanted just wasn't there.

I already have a flashy, Windows running, RGB filled monstrosity of a gaming PC that looks kinda like a Sith holocron -- or maybe just a tower out of Tron. Regardless, it is a very distracting piece of machinery and I didn't want to fiddle about with dual booting. Instead I wanted something smaller and more discrete. A computer just for development. I decided to build a mITX computer with a bit of a retro theme. All of the parts I selected had decent compatibility with Ubuntu and could even be used in [building a Kaby Lake Hackintosh](https://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/february/2018/) if you're so inclined.

Anyways, what follows is primarily just gonna be my parts list and some pictures I took of the case modding process, parts installation, and a few photos of the final machine.

I originally purchased an Intel Core i7 7700k because I got a good deal one one, but I ended up returning it because I was unable to adequately cool it without liquid cooling within the confined space of the Elite 110 case. Since I wasn't planning on overclocking this machine it wasn't necessary anyway. I wanted to purchase 32 GB of RAM, but prices were already much higher than I expected due to cryptocurrency miners.

As I mentioned earlier, I was concerned with the thermals of this case so I decided to spend a bit more and go with a high quality Noctua case fan and one of the better low profile Noctua CPU coolers. As a benefit, the much maligned brown color of the Noctua fans actually complemented my case design. ðŸ˜Š

I selected the ASRock Motherboard due to positive reviews of folks on the TonyMac Hackintosh forums in case I ever wanted to go down that road.

This was last Fall when I purchased these parts. As of writing this post (March 2018) the RAM and graphics card I purchased are now even more exorbitant. ðŸ˜­

## Case Mod

I really liked the cubic design of the Cooler Master Elite 110 and its mesh grate. I wanted to make it a little more my own, however, so I decided to head to Home Depot and get some spray paint. I wanted to go for a more retro look since the case kind of looks like an old speaker, so I went with an off-white, almost cream "Heirloom White" for the case and "Rustic Orange" for the grill.

I took apart the case and sanded down the metal portion to make it easier for the primer to adhere.

I covered pieces of the case that shouldn't be painted (USB ports for example) with painters tape and applied the several coats of primer. After that I applied many many coats of the final paint, sanded down any imperfects, and applied more coats. At the end I applied a final coat of matte clear coat to protect it.

## Build Log

The build was pretty uneventful. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I did take some pictures during the parts and process. I had hoped for some pictures of these parts integrated together as I was researching, so this part of the post is more intended for past me and people like him. ðŸ™‚
