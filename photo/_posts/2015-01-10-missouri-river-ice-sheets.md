I have always been fascinated by the slabs of ice that form on the Missouri River.  After a frigid week, today was the perfect chance to get a closer look. We found some rather "derelicte" stairs that lead down to the river and were able to get a closer look at the floating ice.  [Picture of the stairs for those interested](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuff.downey.io/images/2015/derelicte-stairs-750.jpg).
